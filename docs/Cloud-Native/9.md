## code module

::: tip ISSUES 1859
[feature\] want to implement the k3s runtime module](https://github.com/sealerio/sealer/issues/1859#top)#1859

What a good start [@3293172751](https://github.com/3293172751)! Now i have some suggestions maybe make you more understand about sealer runtime.
the Achieve Interface step is definitely correct. but it would be some misunderstand about k3s's cluterimage rootfs in your chapter ***k3s - rootfs***, i think we do not need to care too much about k3s install package distribution in this stage. I propose a step which is my learning path of sealer,FYI [@3293172751](https://github.com/3293172751) .
What is k8s runtime install interface logic in latest main branch?
How and when sealer install a private registry?
How does the runtime module interact with scripts in rootfs?

## k3s module

::: tip ISSUE
And you mentioned about the k3s installation [online\offline]. I have little confusions.
If sqlite couldn't support cluster HA installation? How to specify the database?
Another question is about install step. AFAIK, k3s support join node by `k3s agent` `k3s server`, so whether you tried this method?
Last, k3s support custom private registry, how to config this? and whether k3s could support external CRI? [@3293172751](https://github.com/3293172751)
