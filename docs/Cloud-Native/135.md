# 135: Deployment of `openim` on Kubernetes with Configuration Management using Helm

**Description**: As part of our infrastructure evolution, we are considering deploying our `openim` application on Kubernetes. Given the application's reliance on specific configurations for MySQL and RPC, we need to devise a strategy that securely and efficiently manages these configurations within a Kubernetes environment.

**Proposed Solution**:

1. **Configuration Split**:

   + **MySQL Configuration**: Given the sensitivity of the MySQL configuration (it contains credentials), this configuration should be stored within a Kubernetes `Secret`.
   + **RPC Configuration**: This configuration can be stored within a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` since it doesn't seem to contain sensitive data.

2. **Configuration Deployment with Helm**:

   Helm, being the package manager for Kubernetes, will allow us to template and package these configurations for easier deployment and management.

   + Create a Helm chart for `openim` with the following structure:

     ```bash
     openim/
     ├── charts/
     ├── templates/
     │   ├── configmap.yaml
     │   ├── secret.yaml
     │   ├── deployment.yaml
     │   ├── service.yaml
     │   └── ... (other Kubernetes objects)
     ├── values.yaml
     └── Chart.yaml
     ```

   + In the `values.yaml` file, provide default values (or placeholders) for all configurations.

   + In `templates/configmap.yaml` and `templates/secret.yaml`, template the configurations to take values from `values.yaml`.

   + Users can then override the default configurations during Helm deployment using their custom values.

3. **Mounting Configurations in the Application**:

   + Mount the MySQL configuration stored in the `Secret` as environment variables within the application container.
   + Mount the RPC configuration from the `ConfigMap` as a file within the application container, and ensure the `openim` application reads configurations from this file path.

4. **Helm Deployment**: Once the Helm chart is created, the application can be deployed using:

   ```bash
   helm install openim ./openim --values custom-values.yaml
   ```

**Tasks**:

+  Split the configurations as per the defined structure.
+  Set up the basic structure of the Helm chart for `openim`.
+  Template the configurations within the Helm chart.
+  Modify the `openim` application to read configurations from the specified paths.
+  Test the deployment on a development Kubernetes cluster.
+  Document the deployment process.

**Benefits**:

+ Improved configuration management.
+ Enhanced security for sensitive configurations.
+ Scalable deployment solution using Helm.
+ Easier application upgrades and rollbacks with Helm.
