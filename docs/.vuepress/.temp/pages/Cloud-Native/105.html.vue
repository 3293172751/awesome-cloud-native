<template><div><p><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p>In order to address the evolving needs of our user base and streamline our development and deployment processes, it's imperative that we implement an automated release and multi-architecture compilation strategy for the Core Repository. This enhancement will not only reduce manual intervention but also ensure compatibility across diverse hardware architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Automated Release</p>
<p>: Automate the process of packaging and releasing new versions of the software in the Core Repository. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version bumping.</li>
<li>Change-log generation.</li>
<li>Notification to stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-Architecture Compilation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that our software is compilable and runs efficiently on multiple hardware architectures.</li>
<li>Implement CI/CD checks for common architectures like x86_64, ARM64, etc.</li>
<li>Provide documentation for supported architectures and potential pitfalls or optimizations for each.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate and select appropriate CI/CD tools that support multi-architecture builds (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI).</li>
<li>Implement automated versioning and release workflows.</li>
<li>Add compilation steps for different architectures in the CI/CD pipeline.</li>
<li>Test builds on actual hardware or emulated environments to ensure proper functionality.</li>
<li>Document the new workflows and provide guidelines for contributors and maintainers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any pre-existing tools or scripts that could aid in this transition should be mentioned.</li>
<li>We might need to consider potential licensing or costs associated with some CI/CD tools.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call to Action</strong>: Looking for feedback from the team regarding potential tools to use and any challenges foreseen in implementing this strategy. Contributions, suggestions, and best practices are welcome!</p>
